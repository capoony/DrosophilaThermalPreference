## Measuring thermal preference in _Drosophila melanogaster_

In this repository, which accompanies our manuscript on the effect of _Wolbachia_ infections on thermal preference in _Drosophila_ hosts ([Strunov _et al._ (2023)](<>)), we describe how to assess thermal preference in _Drosophila melanogaster_ using two different thermal gradient devices. We show the design and operation of the machines and provide software to assess the preferred temperature based on images of the positions of test subjects inside the experimental setup. In addition, we provide the raw images and the _R_ code for the statistical analyses of the data described in Strunov _et al._ ([2023])(<>)

- [Tubular design](Design_tube.md)
- [Plate design](Design_plate.md)
- [Wiring and Setup](Wiring.md)
- [Tutorial](TUTORIAL.md)

2) Supplemental data and _R_ code for Strunov _et al._ ([2023])(<>)

- [Raw Images](Analyses/images/)
- [_R_ code](Analyses/code/)
