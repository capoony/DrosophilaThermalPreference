## Measuring thermal preference in _Drosophila melanogaster_

In this repository, we describe how to assess thermal preference in _Drosophila melanogaster_ using two different thermal gradient machines. We describe the design and operation of the machines and provide software to assess the preferred temperature based on images of the positions of test subjects inside the experimental setup.

1) At first, we explain the design of the two machines:

- [Tubular design](Design_tube.md)
- [Plate design](Design_plate.md)
- [Wiring and Setup](Wiring.md)

2) Next, we explain how the machine is operated

- [Tutorial](TUTORIAL.md)
